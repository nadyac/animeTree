# animeTree
Java Applet for cataloging all of my favorite anime, along with related links, episodes, wikis, and anything else I think is important.

### Core Functionalities
* <b>Add shows to the tree.</b><br> 
  The shows will be organized according to alphanumerical order. The user can also store
  wikis, links, art, fan fictions, and episodes within the tree's nodes (still not an active feature though).<br> 
* <b>Search for shows within the tree.</b><br>
* <b>Remove shows and their related content from the tree</b><br>
